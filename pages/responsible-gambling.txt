**Social Responsibility, Responsible Gaming and low6**↵↵low6 prides itself on providing its customers with a first-class service and a responsible gambling environment. Whilst we want all our customers to bet responsibly and within their means, we acknowledge that the Service Provider also has a responsibility as well as the service user to ensure that the pastime of gambling does not become problem gambling. When the fun stops, gambling should stop. To this end we endeavour to put in place as many measures as possible to protect people who are vulnerable to gambling - be they underage or have susceptibility to gambling problems.↵↵low6 monitors customer responses to the measures implemented and will continue to re-assess and evaluate our policies on Social Responsibility and Responsible Gambling.↵↵low6 provides customers with a range of options listed below to assist them to gamble responsibly.↵↵**Seeking Help with Gambling**↵↵If you believe you may have a problem with gambling, or know someone who does, we encourage you to seek help with the confidential organizations available to offer you the right support to help you combat the problem.↵↵**GAMCARE**↵↵For confidential help and advice with your gambling call The National Gambling Helpline on 0808 6020 133 or visit [Gamcare.org.uk](http://www.gamcare.org.uk/)↵↵If you feel that your gambling has become a problem for you or for a member of your family then contact Gamcare.

This is a free, confidential service that will hopefully encourage those in distress to seek help. The website also contains a number of sections on emotional disorders (types of distress section) and provides some useful statistics. Every counsellor on the site who has submitted their profile has either sent a copy of their qualifications and insurance cover to us, or is registered with a professional body online with recognised codes of ethics and practice, this way we can be assured of their professionalism.↵↵Contact Counselling Directory↵↵Website: [www.counselling-directory.org.uk](http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk)↵↵**Staff Training**↵↵All our Customer Service staff receives awareness training on problem gambling issues.↵↵**Staying in Control of Your Gambling**↵↵Whilst the majority of people do gamble within their means, for some gambling can become a problem. It may help you to keep control to remember the following:↵↵- Gambling should be entertaining and not seen as a way of making money.↵- Be aware of your disposable income - Only gamble what you can afford to lose.↵- Remember that the numbers on the screen are REAL MONEY.↵- Avoid chasing losses.↵- Keep track of the time and amount you spend gambling.↵- Be secure, ensuring you keep your Account details safe, and away from any third party.↵- If you want to have a break from gambling use our self-exclusion option as detailed above.↵↵**Identifying problem Gambling**↵↵If you are concerned that gambling may have taken over your, or someone else&#39;s life, then the following questions may help you find out:↵↵- Do you stay away from work, college or school to gamble?↵- Do you gamble to escape from a boring or unhappy life?↵- When gambling and you run out of money, do you feel lost and in despair and need to gamble again as soon as possible?↵- Do you gamble until your last penny is gone, even the fare home or the cost of a cup of tea?↵- Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you have spent gambling?↵- Have others ever criticized your gambling?↵- Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies?↵- After losing, do you feel you must try and win back your losses as soon as possible?↵- Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to gamble?↵- Do you feel depressed or even suicidal because of your gambling?↵↵The more you answer yes to these questions, the more likely you are to have a serious gambling problem.↵↵**Under Age Gambling**↵↵It is against the law for those under 18 to gamble and low6 takes its responsibilities in this regard very seriously, having various systems in place to aid in the prevention of under-age gambling. Symbols throughout our site indicate that gambling on our website is only permitted by those aged 18 or over and we reserve the right to ask for proof of age from any customer. Customers accounts will be suspended until satisfactory proof of age if required is provided.↵↵The police will be contacted in the event of actual or potential underage gambling and no winnings will be paid on transactions, however we will return stakes to anyone who verifies that they are under 18.↵↵**Parental Controls**↵↵If you wish to monitor or restrict the use of your computers access to the internet, you can use one of the following third-party applications:↵↵Cybersitter filtering software allowing parents to add their own sites to block: [www.cybersitter.com](https://www.cybersitter.com)↵↵Net Nanny filtering software protects children from inappropriate web content: [www.netnanny.com](https://www.netnanny.com)↵↵**Deposit Limits**↵↵By implementing voluntary deposit limits on each account we can help prevent problem gamblers from betting more money than they have initially intended to. Within the My Account section on the website is the facility for each account holder to place a limit on the amount of money that they may deposit to their account within a specified period. This limit can also be implemented by our Customer Service Team on 0121 2951235. These amounts may be revised downwards at any time; however any increase will only be implemented 24 hours following the request, allowing the Customer time to reconsider the decision. Our Customer Services staff will be happy to provide any further information required but are unable to override any limits set by customers.↵↵**Age Verification**↵↵ID3 Global and Risk Guardian Software are integrated into the low6 platform. This controls any attempt of using Low 6 from un-authorised jurisdictions and identify all users age using age verification searches and checks.↵↵**Time-outs**↵↵If you wish to give yourself a break from gambling, a Time-out will freeze your account and it will not be able to be accessed until the time-out has finished.↵↵If a customer wishes to give themselves a rest or time-out from using their account then they have the option to select a time-out for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or any period of time up-to six weeks.↵↵**Self-exclusion or Opt-out**↵↵For those customers who wish to restrict their gambling, we provide a self-exclusion facility enabling customers to close their account or accounts for a period from 6 months up to 5 years. Any exclusion may, on request can be extended for one or more further periods of at least 6 months by contacting customer services.↵↵You can self-exclude from betting activity on your account, using the self-exclusion section under the &quot;My Account&quot; part of the website or by contacting Customer Services on 0121 2951235.↵↵The Self-Exclusion option can be instigated by sending an email to low6 at [info@low6.co.uk](mailto:info@low6.co.uk) with details of all the accounts you have opened with us. During any periods of self-exclusion it will not be possible for the account(s) to be re-opened for any reason, whilst low6 will also do all it can to prevent any new accounts being opened by the customer. Please bear in mind that an account that is simply closed rather than excluded can be re-opened by the customer at any time. If you wish to have your account re-opened, after the self-exclusion period has expired, you will need to email low6 with details of the account(s) you require re-opening. Your account will then become active after 24 hours.↵↵low6 is part of a multi-operator self-exclusion scheme called GAMSTOP.
